### Workflow

#### 1. Detect

##### Edetect.m
  `Edetect` is a basic energy detector designed for use with xwav files.

  - **Input:**
    User is prompted to supply inputs including:
     1. A text file or spreadsheet containing detection parameters (see `GOM_BW_pfile_320.xlsx` for example).
     2. A directory containing xwavs.

  - **Output:**
   A `*_TPWS.mat` file containing matrices of detected signal parameters.

     MPP = peak to peak amplitudes
     MTT = time
     MSN = timeseries (bandpassed)
     MSP = spectrum (bandpassed)

  *Optional*:
     MUSN = unfiltered timeseries
     MUSP = unfiltered spectrum

#### 2. Make LTSA snippets

##### mkLTSAsessions.m
  `mkLTSAsessions` prepares small LTSAs for each detection bout.

  - **Input:**
   1. User is prompted to input a code to identify the detected species.
     Current options include:
     `Ko` or `k`: Kogia
     `Zc` or `z`: Cuvier's beaked whale
     `Me` or `m`: Gervais' beaked whale
     `BWG` or `g`: Unidentified beaked whale BWG
     `Md` or `d`: Beaked whale BW31
     `De` or `de`: Delphinid

   2. User is prompted to select transfer function file

  - **Output:**
   A `*_LTSA.mat` file is produced.

#### 3. Edit detections

##### detEdit.m

   - **Input:**
   User is prompted to:
     * input a code to identify the detected species (as in step 2).
     * input an interval for looking at false detections.
     (To estimate a false positive rate, a good number might = total # of detections/N, where N is 300 or more.)

     * select a tranfer function.
     * select directory containing `_TPWS.mat` and `_LTSA.mat` files.
     * Starting session (use **1** to start with first bout).

   - **Editing tools & shortcuts:**
  ToDo

   - **Output:**
  ToDo

#### 4. Update detections

##### modDet.m

   - **Input:**

   - **Output:**
